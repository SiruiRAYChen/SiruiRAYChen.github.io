## Teaching & Mentorship

Throughout my academic journey, I've been passionate about helping others understand complex computer science concepts. My experience as a teaching assistant has not only deepened my own understanding but also honed my ability to break down intricate topics into digestible explanations.

I believe that the best way to master a subject is to teach it to others, and I'm always eager to share knowledge with fellow students and aspiring engineers.
