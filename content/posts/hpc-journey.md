## How I Discovered My Passion for GPU Programming

When I first started my undergraduate studies at **Middlebury College**, I was fascinated by both mathematics and computer science. But it wasn't until I took a course on **Computer Architecture** that I truly understood the power of understanding hardware to optimize software.

### The Turning Point

During my junior year, I worked on a project that required processing large datasets. My initial Python implementation was painfully slow—it took *hours* to complete what should have been a simple computation. That's when I learned about **parallel programming** and **GPU acceleration**.

> "The moment I saw my first CUDA program achieve a 100× speedup over CPU, I was hooked."

### From Theory to Practice

I dove deep into understanding:
- **Memory hierarchies** and cache optimization
- **Thread synchronization** and avoiding race conditions
- **GPU architecture** and the SIMT execution model
- **Performance profiling** and identifying bottlenecks

### Current Focus

Now at **Northwestern University** pursuing my Master's, I'm working on even more ambitious projects:

1. **Parallel Scan Algorithms** - Achieving 15× speedups on 16M+ elements
2. **AI-Powered Recommendation Systems** - Using CUDA to accelerate neural network training
3. **Generative AI Applications** - Building real-world tools that help students learn

### What's Next?

I'm excited to explore:
- **Transformer optimization** for large language models
- **Distributed training** across multiple GPUs
- **Real-time inference** for production AI systems

The intersection of **AI and high-performance computing** is where I see the future, and I'm thrilled to be part of this revolution.
